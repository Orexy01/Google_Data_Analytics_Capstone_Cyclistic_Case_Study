## Introduction
<p>This capstone project marks the end of all my learning throughout the courses of the <a href= "https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics">Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate</a>.  In this case study, I will analyze a public dataset for a fictitious company, Cyclistic.

## Background
### Scenario
<p>I am assuming a role as a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, my team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, my team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve my recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.</p>

### Cyclistic Company
<p>Cyclistic is a fictional bike-share company based in Chicago. Cyclistic operates a fleet of 5800 bicycles which can be accessed in 600 docking stations across Chicago. Cyclistic sets itself apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes; about 8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use them to commute to work each day.</p>

#### Business Task: 
Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members.

## Data Analysis Processes
### 1. Ask
Three questions will guide the future marketing program:
1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

### 2. Prepare
<p>I will use Cyclistic’s historical trip data to analyze and identify trends from Jan 2022 to Dec 2022 which can be downloaded from [divvy_tripdata](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html).
